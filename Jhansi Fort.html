     Introduction
    </h2>
     <p>We know, just by reading the name of Jhansi who came to your mind. You guessed right. This is the fort in which brave queen of Jhansi – Rani Laxmi Bai used to live. Her legends are known to every single child in Jhansi that how she fought for her dignity and for her motherland. This fort is crowned on the hilltop of Bangura and adds up to the beauty of this city. Jhansi Fort is built with an amalgamation of Bundela style and Maratha style of architecture. Its granite walls are around 20 feet thick. Best time to visit Jhansi Fort is in January and February when Jhansi Mahotsav is organised by the authorities and local artists come to perform in the fort. Beauty and legends of Jhansi Fort are the true pride of India. </p>
    <h3>
    History
    </h3><p>The history of the Gwalior Fort
        According to historians, there isn’t any concrete proof to indicate exactly when the fort was constructed. However, a local legend tells us that it was built in 3 CE by a local king called Suraj Sen. A saint named Gwalipa came wandering to the fort and met the king, who was suffering from leprosy. When Gwalipa offered him some water from a sacred pond (now called Suraj Kund and located within the fort complex), he immediately became healthy again. As a thankful gesture to the saint, the king named the fort and the town after him. The saint then gave the king the title of ‘Pal’ (protector) and told him that as long as he and his family continue to bear this title, the fort would remain in their possession. Following this, 83 successors of Suraj Sen controlled the fort. But the 84th king, Tej Karan, did not bear the title and lost the fort.

    <h4>
        The structure of the Gwalior Fort
    </h4><p>
        With well-maintained premises, the fort complex includes several temples, palaces and water tanks. The main monuments inside the Gwalior Fort complex
Jain temples form unique monuments inside the fort, with the Siddhachal Caves and Gopachal rock-cut Jain monuments being the two areas, complete with thousands of Jain Tirthankar idols defaced during the Mughal invasion. Teli Ka Mandir and Sahastrabahu (Sas-Bahu) Ka Mandir are the two architecturally rich Hindu temples here. Gurudwara Data Bandi Chhor is another holy place built inside the fort’s complex, and it was where Sikh Guru Hargobind Sahib was kept as a captive by Mughal Emperor Jahangir. Man Mandir Palace, Gujari Mahal, Assi Khamba Ki Baoli, and Suraj Kund are other important monuments found in the complex.
The fort lies on an area of three square kilometres (1.1 square miles) and has two entrance gates: the main entrance being the Elephant Gate (Hathi Pul) on the north-east side with a long ramp and the other called the Badalgarh Gate on the south-west side. Man Mandir Palace sits on the north-east side.
