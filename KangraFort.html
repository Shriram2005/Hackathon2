    <h2>
     Introduction
    </h2>
     <p> :- Kangra Fort is nestled in the hills of Kangra which is around 20 kilometres away from Dharmashala in Himachal Pradesh. This magnetic fort was built by Rajput family of Kangra state. In 1615, Akbar tried to siege the fort with his vigorous army but the thick and solid walls protected the dignity of the royal family. Kangra Fort has seen many mighty rulers even including British rule but unfortunately, it was destroyed by an earthquake in 1905. But travellers can still visit the fort and get astonished by its grey walls covered with greenery all around.</p>
    <h3>
    History
    </h3><p>Almost 3500 years ago, Maharaja Sushma Chandra of the Katoch dynasty built the Kangra Fort. This was after he defeated the Kaurava princes in the Mahabharata. Kangra Fort was constructed with the king’s intention to build such a dome which can safeguard the kingdom and the king from the enemies during the attack. 
        Because the Fort of Kangra always remained flooded with treasure, there were many kings like Mahmud Ghazni, Alexander the Great, and more, who tried to invade the fort. The reason behind the brimming treasure troves of the Kangra Fort is that the Hind rulers of south-Asia used to send gold, silver, and an immense number of jewels as an offering to the deities inside the temples at the Fort. The reason behind these offerings was to earn meritorious karma, so much so that it became difficult to manage the treasure wells inside the Fort.  
        Interestingly, Kangra Fort’s very first attack came from a king named Shreshtha, the then Raja of Kashmir, in 470 AD.  As per foreign invasion’s record, no ruler has ever managed to at least step inside the fort, until Ghazni Mahmud, who managed to break the defences of the Fort in  1009 AD. His attempt is said to be so close to perfection that the garrison that was guarding the Fort, did not even hinder his entry. It is amazing to imagine the action, isn’t it?

        Architectural Design of The Kangra Fort
    </h5>
    <p>
        The fort of Kangra is spread over 463 acres, with a long area of 4 kms on each side of the outer circuit. From its majestic ramparts, the fort   used to be monitored by the soldiers. There are black stone walls surrounding the arena that keep the essence of its background in a right place. Along with 23 bastions and a palace courtyard, there are a total of 11 gateways at Kangra. 
This courtyard has been dedicated to many Hindu gods and goddesses, including Ambika Devi, Lakshmi Narayan, and Lord Mahavira. Here, a door named “Andheri Darwaza” is quite a visiting place which is just outside the main temple. This is also known as a defence gateway that is 7 meters wide, with a height of 15 ft.
